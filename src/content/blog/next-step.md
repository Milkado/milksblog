## Lost passion

Last year I lived through the worst ten months of my professional life. I had good years at the company, met really cool people, that turned to good friends. But my passion about tech vanished in the last months, I doubted my skills, started to think that working in tech was not for me. It's funny how one bad - really bad - manager can mess up years of work, and destroy motivation (and possibly a company). I turned into a shell to myself, nothing interested me, I've done some interviews but I couldn't bring my excitement. That was really bad to an interviewer eyes (I had a direct complain), and faking it felt forced, I made me feel worse. But that was not the ending.

## New found adventure

One slepless night I thought back the last year, replayed my experiences in memory. In 2025 I played amazing games, read amazing books (and some comics), in the trance I realized: I used to love creating stuff. Stuff being stories, software, worlds. 2025 took that from me, but what if I could combine my passion of coding to my love telling stories/creating worlds? "What about creating a game?" That what a thought. And a fire reignated inside of me. To where the credits are due, two games really motivated me: Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur. The former united amazing story telling, gameplay, music. The latter had the same, a game purely built on passion. So thats what I will do! Bring my passion to a game I would love to play.

## Roadmap

Here's what I thought: I know how to code, so I shoud strat where I lack the most. Story I can write relatively fast, lore takes a bit of time, but I've done it before coutless of times (I love RPGs). That leaves two things: drawing and music. I suck at drawing, much more than music (I used to play a few instruments). So I will start there! In truth, I somewhat already done some stuff. I'm doing pixel art, it's no easier, but more acessible. Some suff here was made by me! I total artless guy done ugly art! The site icon (the little milk box), the ugly flags for localization, and the post banners (that you can see the little milk box, it's ugly, but I'm proud to done that with no references). 

So the complete plan is:

1. Learn pixel art and some drawing
2. Start creating a game using GameMaker engine and MonoGame
3. Audio and music for games
4. Plan a full game

It seems simple, but it'll be a lot of work, but I'm excited!

So, see you next time with bunch of doodles. :)
